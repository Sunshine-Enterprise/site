        <p>When preparing for job interviews, candidates worry about unanticipated questions, and employers worry about making the right hire. There's now another unknown. Just what exactly are the kinds of challenges colleges and universities are going to encounter in a post-pandemic environment?

          That means hiring committees must ask candidates how they would handle some hypothetical situation or, more vaguely, the overall unknown that lies ahead. In other words, candidates need to anticipate questions about unanticipated scenarios.

          Good luck with that.

          Actually, Michael Taberski had good luck fielding those types of questions. Recently hired as vice president for student and campus life at SUNY Geneseo, Taberski estimated that nearly a quarter of his interview questions were coronavirus-related issues. And even for questions not explicitly addressing the pandemic, he couldn't just ignore potential issues.</p>
